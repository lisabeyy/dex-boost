This latest development introduces a human-readable username system designed to streamline the complexities associated with cryptocurrency wallet addresses, particularly the lengthy and intricate 0x addresses.\n\n## Claim your Uniswap ENS for free by downloading the Uniswap Mobile App\n\nThe uni.eth usernames, integrated seamlessly within the Uniswap app, enable users to convert their cumbersome wallet addresses into easily memorable and shareable usernames at no cost. This initiative leverages the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) infrastructure, a decentralized domain name system built on Ethereum, to offer broad compatibility across various Web3 applications.\n\nUniswap's decision to roll out uni.eth addresses is driven by the recognition of 0x addresses as a significant hurdle to widespread blockchain adoption. \n\nThe potential for errors in manually inputting these addresses can lead to severe consequences, such as loss of funds or failed contract interactions. By introducing user-friendly usernames, Uniswap aims to mitigate these risks and enhance the onboarding experience for newcomers to decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 platforms.\n\nIn a blog post, Uniswap emphasized the transformative impact of usernames, providing users with easily recognizable on-chain identities that transcend the technical complexities of traditional wallet addresses. This move not only simplifies transactions but also fosters social connections by allowing users to create personalized profiles within the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nWhat sets uni.eth apart is its compatibility beyond the Uniswap app. Thanks to its integration with the ENS, uni.eth usernames can be utilized across a wide range of Web3 applications, including DeFi platforms, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, virtual worlds, and other blockchain-powered services. This interoperability ensures a seamless experience for uni.eth users navigating diverse blockchain ecosystems.\n\nClaiming a custom uni.eth username is straightforward and requires users to download the Uniswap app, where they can select a wallet address to associate with their chosen username. Furthermore, the app offers additional customization options such as avatars, bios, and links to social media profiles, empowering users to craft a unique Web3 identity.\n\nAs the adoption of ENS and uni.eth usernames gains momentum, Uniswap envisions a future where individuals can present themselves consistently across various internet communities, thereby humanizing interactions within the blockchain space. This shift toward user-centric design and enhanced accessibility holds the potential to accelerate mainstream adoption and drive broader engagement with decentralized technologies. Uni.eth is not just a new feature but a catalyst for revolutionizing how we engage with blockchain-powered platforms, paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly Web3 experience."},{"group":"blog","slug":"blog/post-2","frontmatter":{"title":" Uniswap v4: Revolutionizing DeFi with Customizable Liquidity Pools","meta_title":" Discover Uniswap v4: A Game-Changing Evolution in Decentralized Finance","description":": Uniswap v4 is here, offering customizable liquidity pools, innovative hooks, gas savings, and community-driven governance.

The introduction of \"hooks\" stands out as a game-changer, allowing users to make crucial tradeoff decisions within liquidity pools. These hooks are essentially contracts that execute actions at specific points during a pool's lifecycle, offering unparalleled flexibility and customization.\n\nOne of the key highlights of Uniswap v4 is its support for custom pools through hooks. These hooks enable developers to innovate on top of the Uniswap Protocol, paving the way for exciting experiments such as time-weighted average market makers (TWAMM), dynamic fee structures based on volatility, onchain limit orders, and more. The possibilities are virtually limitless, empowering users to create pools tailored to their unique requirements.\n\nMoreover, Uniswap v4 introduces a revolutionary architecture with a \"singleton\" contract, consolidating all pools within a single smart contract. This architectural shift not only reduces costs but also ensures efficient routing across multiple pools, enhancing the overall user experience. Gas savings are a significant highlight, with v4 estimated to reduce pool creation gas costs by a staggering 99%.\n\nAnother notable aspect is the emphasis on openness and transparency. Uniswap v4's code will be released under a Business Source License 1.1, ensuring accessibility while also maintaining governance through the Uniswap community. The governance model, similar to v3, empowers the community to oversee and make decisions regarding the protocol's evolution and fee mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, Uniswap v4 represents a groundbreaking evolution in decentralized exchange protocols, offering unparalleled customization, efficiency, and transparency. With its innovative features and community-driven governance, Uniswap v4 is poised to redefine the landscape of decentralized finance and onchain liquidity provision."}]
